# Implementation Summary: Laravel Permission-Based Role System with Grade Appeals

## 🎯 Requirements Completed

### ✅ 1. Auto-assign 'exstudent' role to newly registered users
**Location:** `app/Http/Controllers/Web/UsersController.php` - `doRegister()` method
- New users automatically receive the 'exstudent' role upon registration
- Implementation: `$user->assignRole('exstudent');`

### ✅ 2. Teachers and managers can see appeal status beside any grade
**Location:** `resources/views/grades/list.blade.php`
- Added "Appeal Status" column visible to users with `show_exgrades` permission
- Displays detailed status with timestamps and reasons:
  - 🔘 **No Appeal** (none)
  - ⚠️ **Pending** (with reason and submission time)
  - ✅ **Approved** (with response and approval time)
  - ❌ **Rejected** (with response and rejection time)
  - ℹ️ **Appeal Closed** (when grade is modified)

### ✅ 3. Students can press an "appeal" button beside any grade
**Location:** `resources/views/grades/list.blade.php`
- Appeal button appears for students on their own grades (when status is 'none')
- Modal form allows students to submit detailed appeal reasons
- Protected by `submit_grade_appeal` permission

### ✅ 4. Show teacher response with approval/rejection status
**Location:** Multiple files
- **View:** Enhanced status display shows response text and timestamps
- **Controller:** `GradesController@respondToAppeal()` handles teacher responses
- **Modal:** Teacher response form with approval/rejection options

### ✅ 5. Users can see their permissions in their profile
**Location:** `resources/views/users/profile.blade.php` & `app/Http/Controllers/Web/UsersController.php`
- Profile displays all user permissions (direct + role-based)
- Shows permissions as green badges with readable names
- Comprehensive permission aggregation from roles and direct assignments

### ✅ 6. Grade changes automatically close appeals
**Location:** `app/Http/Controllers/Web/GradesController.php` - `save()` method
- Detects when grade is modified
- Automatically sets appeal_status to 'closed' for active appeals
- Prevents stale appeals on modified grades

## 🗄️ Database Schema Changes

### Grades Table (Migration: `add_appeal_functionality_to_grades_table`)
```sql
appeal_status ENUM('none', 'pending', 'approved', 'rejected', 'closed') DEFAULT 'none'
appeal_reason TEXT NULL
appealed_at TIMESTAMP NULL
appeal_response TEXT NULL
appeal_responded_at TIMESTAMP NULL
```

1. **`submit_grade_appeal`** - Students can submit appeals
2. **`respond_to_grade_appeal`** - Teachers can respond to appeals  
3. **`view_grade_appeals`** - View appeal status information

### Permission Assignments
- **exstudent role:** `submit_grade_appeal`
- **exteacher role:** `respond_to_grade_appeal`, `view_grade_appeals`

## 🚀 New Routes Added
